should individually perform a single responsibility while also ensuring that the
principles of DRY and SOLID are applied in your entire design.
3. Coding: Clean code. Good coding style. Good comments for easy readability,
4. Testing: You should add test cases for the main functions of the system.
5. Deployment: Host your solution on probably a free online hosting platform and
share the link.
6. Documentation: Provide clear backend API documentation. (Use Postman or
